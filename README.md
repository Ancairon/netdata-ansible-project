# netdata-ansible-project

As of now, this project serves a research assignment on my University, using the Netdata API, ansible, vagrant and python.

The goal is to have a system monitored by watcher.py and try to detect "bugs" generated by dbtest.py.

watcher.py applies a t-score to the metrics collected from *(minutes)* [0,-2] against the ones collected from [-2,-8].

Currently it is made to look on the system.cpu chart under the user dimension, and on the net.{interface} chart under the received dimension. 

If it finds any anomalies, it will print an error message to the screen.

I am stressing the VM (and not the host to not hinder the setup and scale down experiment time) using dbtest.py that pings a local MariaDB database located on an rpi.
The table that is used is the sample "Employees" table that MariaDB/MySql provide. 

This is an evolving project and the first changes are proof-of-concept targeted and as time moves on I will expand it to be more accurate in its tests and in the way it monitors the system.
